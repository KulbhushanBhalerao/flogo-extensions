## Basic Variable Substitution

### Example 1: Simple Greeting

**Template:**
```pongo2
Hello {{ name }}! Welcome to {{ company }}.
Your role is {{ role }} 
{% if experience == 0 %} and welcome to your first professional role!
{% elif experience > 0 %} and well done on your {{ experience }} years of experience!{% endif %}
{% if experience == 10 or experience == 15 or experience == 20 %} We truly appreciate your significant contribution to the industry.{% endif %}
```
** JSON Schema **
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
    "type": "object",

## Usage Tips

### 1. Variable Naming
- Use descriptive variable names: `user_name` instead of `name`
- Use snake_case for consistency: `order_total` not `orderTotal`
- Avoid reserved words and special characters

- **Numbers**: `42`, `3.14`
- **Booleans**: `true`, `false`
- **Arrays**: `["item1", "item2", "item3"]`
- **Objects**: `{"key": "value", "nested": {"data": true}}`

### 3. Common Filters
- `|default:"fallback"` - Use fallback if variable is empty
- `|length` - Get length of string or array
- `|floatformat:2` - Format numbers with 2 decimal places
- `|title` - Capitalize first letter of each word
- `|upper` / `|lower` - Convert case
- `|join:", "` - Join array elements with comma

### 4. Loop Variables
- `forloop.Counter` - 1-based index (1, 2, 3...)
- `forloop.Counter0` - 0-based index (0, 1, 2...)
- `forloop.First` - True for first iteration
- `forloop.Last` - True for last iteration

```bash
cd utils
./generate_flogo_params.sh "Your template here"
```
